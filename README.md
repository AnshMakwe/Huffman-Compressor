# Huffman-Compressor
Repository contains a C++ implementation of a Huffman compressor, a lossless data compression algorithm based on Huffman coding. The Huffman compressor efficiently reduces the size of data files by assigning shorter codes to more frequently occurring characters, resulting in significant compression ratios for various types of data.
